# Target Protein Database

The aligner can accomodate any protein database containing a set of amino acid sequences in FASTA format.
For benchmarking purposes, we began by using the [standard RefSeq protein database](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/annotation/annotation_releases/110/GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14/) and then transitioned to [MANE protein database](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/MANE_human/release_1.0/). 
The reason behind making this shift was explained in the final report. The zip file contains the standard RefSeq protein sequences that we started with.
