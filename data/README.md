# Target Protein Database

The aligner can accomodate any protein database containing a set of amino acid sequences in FASTA format.
For benchmarking purposes, we began by using the standard RefSeq protein database and then transitioned to MANE protein database. 
The reason behind making this shift was explained in the final report. The zip file contains the standard RefSeq protein sequences that we started with.
